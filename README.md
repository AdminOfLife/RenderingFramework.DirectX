RenderingFramework.DirectX
==========================

Managed Wrapper around the DirectDraw 7 Interface

Information:

In order to compile the project you’ll need the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=529f03be-1339-48c4-bd5a-8506e5acf571&displaylang=en">August 2007 DirectX SDK</a>, which is the latest version of the DirectX SDK that ships with the necessary headers and libraries referenced by the project for DirectDraw support.

If you simply want to use the library in your own application the pre-compiled binary can be downloaded <a href="https://www.box.com/s/dzyy7zd0qd7fox71nu5d">here</a>. From your application choose "Add Reference", then browse to the physical library location, and you’re free to use it like any other CLR type.
