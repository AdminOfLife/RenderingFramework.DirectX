RenderingFramework.DirectX
==========================

Managed Wrapper around the DirectDraw 7 Interface

Information:

In order to compile the project you’ll need the August 2007 DirectX SDK, which is the latest version of the DirectX SDK that ships with the nessacerry headers and libraries referenced by the project for DirectDraw support.

If you just want to use the binary in your own application simply add a reference to the DLL in the “bin” folder, and you’re free to use it like any other managed object demonstrated in the sample code above.
